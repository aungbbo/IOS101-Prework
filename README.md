## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1) Notion
- AI-powered summaries and writing assistance
- Real-time collaboration on shared workspaces

2) Spotify
- Music recommendations based on listening habits
- Collaborative playlists with friends

3) Instagram
- Ability to edit and apply filters to photos and videos before posting
- Direct messaging with disappearing messages for privacy

4) Snapchat
- Users maintain streaks by messaging friends daily
- Personalized avatars that represent users in chats and stories.

I would like to build a personal finance tracker that can track users' daily expenses based on categories like dining, entertainment, grocery, etc., and display an anaylized, user-friendly dashboard.


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Setting up Xcode and connecting UI to logic was a bit challenging for me since I was not very familiar with the Xcode environment.
